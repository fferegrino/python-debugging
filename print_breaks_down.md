# Where `print` breaks down

In this example, using `print` statements to debug the binary search algorithm could be challenging:

1. **Recursive Calls**: With each recursive call, the state of the input parameters changes. This can quickly become difficult to track with `print` statements, especially if the array is large.

2. **Volume of Output**: Adding `print` statements inside the recursive function would result in a large number of outputs for each call, cluttering the console and making it hard to follow the algorithm's progress.

3. **State at Different Levels**: Binary search involves checking the state of the search at different levels of recursion. `print` statements can show you the state at a given level, but they don't provide an easy way to compare states across different levels of recursion.

4. **Mid-Computation State**: If you're trying to understand the mid-computation state of the algorithm (e.g., the value of `mid`), `print` statements can help, but they are not interactive and don't allow you to modify the state on-the-fly for experimentation.
